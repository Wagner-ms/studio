# **App Name**: Valicare

## Core Features:

- Product List: Implement a home screen displaying a product list sorted by expiration date, highlighting expired products (red) or near expiration (yellow).
- Product Registration: Design a registration screen using the device's camera, implementing OCR for extracting product name, lot number and expiration date from labels.
- Smart OCR: Implement an OCR tool, triggered when the user snaps a photo of the product label, that identifies the product name, batch number, and expiration date. It should clearly display the results.
- Report Screen: Present a dashboard to display simple metrics on the number of expired and soon-to-expire products. Offer visually clear summaries rather than raw data.
- Notifications Screen: Notifications Screen - Allow to consult any notifications the app has displayed in the past.
- Photo Capture: Implement the capture and storage of the photo from the label. Make the image consultable by users to verify the data the app captured.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#57A7EB) to evoke freshness and reliability, but not be too cold or corporate.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EAF3FA), close in hue to the primary color, but much lighter and desaturated for a clean, airy feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant lime green (#A4F443) for positive actions (e.g., saving a product) and important notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short text; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear and modern icons for navigation and product categories, focusing on recognizability and simplicity.
- Maintain a clean, card-based design for the product list to clearly display essential information.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for actions such as adding a product or viewing details to give feedback without distracting the user.
